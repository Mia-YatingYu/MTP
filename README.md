# Introduction

![STDD](figures\STDD.jpg)

This paper presents a novel CLIP-based framework, **Spatiotemporal Dynamic Duo** (STDD), designed to comprehend multi-modal spatiotemporal dynamics flexibly through simple yet effective operations applied before and after spatial attention for the vision modality and refining semantic modality with spatiotemporal text augmentation.
